  <h4>We all need a home. Young professionals, families with kids, empty nesters, seniors, workers, people with
    disabilities, people struggling to make ends meet – all of us need somewhere to live.</h4>
  <p>Making sure that Greater Boston has enough of those places to live for all kinds of people and for all income
    levels is <a href="http://www.mapc.org/get-involved/metrofuture-our-regional-plan/">a core part of MAPC’s work</a>.
    So is making sure that those places to live are safe, sustainable, healthful, and convenient to work and
    transportation. Those things matter – not just to the people looking to settle down, but for the region’s <a
      href="http://www.mapc.org/get-involved/equity-at-mapc/">equity</a>, <a
      href="http://www.mapc.org/our-work/expertise/public-health/">public health</a>, <a
      href="http://www.mapc.org/learn/projections/">economy</a>, and <a
      href="http://www.mapc.org/our-work/expertise/environment/">environment</a>.</p>
  <p>MAPC collects, interprets, and shares housing data. We advocate at the state level for legislation to help promote
    our housing goals, and work with municipalities to create planning documents, local masterplans, and model bylaws.
    We support regional collaboration by helping communities work together to advance their goals.</p>
