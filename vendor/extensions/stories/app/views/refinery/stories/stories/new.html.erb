        <p>For MetroCommon 2050 to make real change, a lot of people will have to take action. But they’ll only take action if the plan is worthwhile. That’s why MAPC is seeking public input every step of the way.</p>
        <p>What are we doing with all this input? <a href="/stories">Cataloging it</a>, analyzing it, and incorporating what we learn into the plan. Please give us your thoughts! With your help, the plan will be bold and actionable, it will be right for the region, and it will lead to real change</p>
        <h2>Visioning: What do we want?</h2>
        <p>The first step in creating MetroCommon is for those of us who live, work, and play in the region to figure out what we want for our future. We’ll use machine learning to transcribe, catalog, and analyze your response, and look for trends across all the answers. We’ll keep those trends in mind as we draft regional goals. Please share what you want the region to be like in 2050!</p>
