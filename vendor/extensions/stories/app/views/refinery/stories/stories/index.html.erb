          Opinions, ideas, and priorities that spring from the lived experience of the people of the region are an important part of MetroCommon. We’re paying close attention to public feedback at every stage of the planning process. With your help, the plan will be bold, it will be right for the region, and it will lead to real change.

          Today, we’re asking what the region thinks about the MetroCommon Draft Goals. For months, hundreds of people from everywhere in the region have told us what they want for Greater Boston's future (see samples below). MAPC took all the ideas and hopes and grouped them into draft goals. Now we want to know if we got it right. Do the goals talk about a future that you want? And if not, how should the goals change?
