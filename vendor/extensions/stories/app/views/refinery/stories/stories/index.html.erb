          Opinions, ideas, and priorities that spring from the lived experience of the people of the region are an 
          important part of MetroCommon. We’re collecting public input at every stage of the planning process.
        <br />
        <br />
          The first step in creating MetroCommon is for those of us who live, work, and play in the region to 
          figure out what we want for our future. We’re using both direct and indirect ways to prompt people’s 
          thoughts. Some questions are playful, some serious. We’re asking in person and on line, and urging 
          responses in video, audio, and written forms. We are cataloging and analyzing responses, and looking 
          for trends across all the answers. We’ll keep those trends in mind as we draft regional goals.
