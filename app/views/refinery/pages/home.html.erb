          <p>A message to the people who live and work in Metropolitan Boston:</p>
          <p>In 2008, we adopted our last regional land use and policy plan, MetroFuture, and it guided our work for over a decade. Although many MetroFuture recommendations have been implemented, the region still faces many of the same big challenges: increasing disparities in income, wealth, and health by race, a lack of affordable housing, growing negative impacts of climate change, and an overburdened transportation system. Our new plan, MetroCommon 2050: Shaping our Region Together, attempts to confront these threats and delineates a path to work together to create a more sustainable and equitable region.</p>
          <p>Developing a roadmap for the region during a pandemic and racial reckoning has not been easy. However, we believe it has both strengthened and humbled us in important ways, leading we hope to a stronger guide to the future. When we began this plan, no one had heard of COVID-19 and few knew who George Floyd was. We have experienced great political, social, and economic upheaval in the past year. Many lives have been lost and the economic dislocation has hit women, service workers, and people of color particularly hard across the nation and right here in Greater Boston. Last summer, thousands marched for racial justice. Last winter, we experienced a polarizing election and a failed attempt at insurrection. These global, national, regional, and local events are affecting us all and have shaped this plan. MetroCommon is a 30-year plan for building a more equitable and more resilient region, but it is also a plan that identifies historic exclusion, oppression, and unfairness that continue today. It offers actionable recommendations for ensuring that our recovery is equitable and places our region on a trajectory to reach our shared, long-term goals.</p>
          <p>MetroCommon is about hope for the future. At the very beginning of this planning process, the first questions we asked people were, “What do you hope for the future? What kind of region do you want for yourself, your children, and the next generation?” We turned those responses into the vision and goals of the plan. We explored the possible barriers against reaching those goals, including future uncertainties like changes in transportation technologies and demographics. And then we identified what we can do, together, to work towards the future that we all want. Together we have the power and ability to be the change that we desire.</p>
          <p>We look forward to working with you to build a more equitable and resilient region.</p>

        <h2>Shaping our region together</h2>
        <p>Metropolitan Boston is home to a vibrant, diverse population of five million. We’re a hub of innovation and tradition, of learning and culture, of sports, of history, of medicine – and that just scratches the surface. We also face big challenges, including the cost of housing, racial inequity, and a changing climate. MetroCommon 2050 is a road map for meeting those challenges. And for launching the region into a more equitable and resilient future.</p>
        <p>MetroCommon is a land-use and policy plan designed to be used. It looks at how issues affect residents and workers throughout our region of 101 cities and towns. It offers actionable policy recommendations and useful research and tools. And every aspect of the plan, from goals to analysis, has been vetted by people who live here, very much including people from historically marginalized communities.</p>
        <p>Please delve into the MetroCommon material and share it widely. Let us know what you think and what else you’d like to know. But most of all, put it to work. Together, we can build the future we want. But to achieve that future, we have to act. It won’t be easy, but it’ll be worth it. Let’s shape the region together!</p>

            <p class="about-plan--description-text">MetroCommon 2050 is Greater Boston’s long-term land use and policy plan. It seeks to connect the Greater Boston of today to a more just, sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future. To do this, we need to understand the conditions on the ground for our residents, workers, businesses, and ecosystems, and the trajectories along which they are moving. Research conducted as part of the MetroCommon planning process can help us to see some of the patterns and idiosyncrasies of the region, and to imagine possibilities for its future.</p>
            <p class="about-plan--description-text">We used the research developed as part of MetroCommon to understand our region more fully and to provide data and evidence answering key questions. The research findings supported the development of both the action areas and the plan’s public policy recommendations. We held public release events throughout the planning process to highlight the new insights and tools that have been developed.</p>

            <h2 class="about-plan--description-title">About the Regional Plan</h2>
            <p class="about-plan--description-text">It’s a set of actions that local and state government can take to improve the region over time. Plans
              like MetroCommon can include thinking about many different aspects of our lives. That’s because policies and laws can affect jobs, transportation, health, and more.</p>
            <p class="about-plan--description-text">MetroCommon will focus on challenges and opportunities that are bigger than any one place. And it will look at how those issues are connected. Topics like traffic congestion, the rising cost of housing, our changing climate, equity of wealth and health, and efficient government – all will be part of the mix.</p>
