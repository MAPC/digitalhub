<p>We’ll need to increase renewable energy production and energy efficiency dramatically – and quickly – while ensuring access and affordability for EJ populations. We must implement microgrids, energy storage, and reduce peak demand. Electric and gas utility markets will need to support greater decentralized generation, better and more expanded transmission, and much higher levels of renewable energy. We will need resources for deep energy retrofits and higher performance standards for both new construction and renovation of existing buildings. Furthermore, public and personal transportation will need to turn sharply toward an electric future that does not aggravate congestion or sprawl.</p>
<p>To move towards a more resilient region, we must focus on the following priority areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expanding green infrastructure, microgrids, and energy storage, especially in Environmental Justice locations</li>
  <li>Preparing our buildings and infrastructure to better withstand the negative impacts of climate change</li>
  <li>Moving out of harm’s way, through a willing seller’s program, better regulatory signals on where to build and where not to build, and improving our flood programs and data</li>
</ul>
<p>Climate change will also significantly threaten and impact our water resources, including drinking water and stormwater. To better manage our finite freshwater resources, we need to move to an integrated water resource management approach, increase local recharge, and ensure affordable access to water through investments and limits on non-essential outdoor water use.</p>
