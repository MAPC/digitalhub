<p>We face many challenges to realizing a net zero, climate resilient region, but these challenges are surmountable. The pace at which we must act, however, is daunting. Current international consensus is that we have until 2030 to reduce global GHG by at least 45% below 2010 levels and achieve net zero by 2050 to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Here in Massachusetts, the new climate law, An Act Creating a Next Generation Roadmap for Massachusetts Climate Policy, signed by Governor Baker in early 2021, commits the Commonwealth to attain 50% reductions below 1990 levels by 2030 and 75% by 2040, on our way to net zero by 2050.</p>
<p>All of these targets require immediate action to undertake the necessary changes to achieve these statutory outcomes fully and on time. Failure is not an option. The decisions made by various levels of government (federal, state, regional, and local); individuals; and private sector organizations must be aligned, regardless of corporate or political cycles. We cannot allow quarterly profit targets and two- to four-year political terms become barriers to making decisions and investments that are needed to protect future generations.</p>
<p>Price signals are another barrier to consumers making choices that could minimize the relentless march of climate change. There are longstanding subsidies supporting fossil fuels, industrial agriculture, and global trade. Because of these subsidies, cheap and more environmentally-damaging clothes, food, cars, heating and cooling systems, and other goods are often the less expensive option for consumers. For households with limited discretionary budgets, the less expensive option is often the only option.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve recently seen renewable energy generation costs become competitive with fossil fuels, and rebates for electric vehicles are narrowing the price premium over gas-powered cars. But for so many products and goods, the least expensive options are those with the highest environmental impact and the conventional product, even with cost parity, is often the preferred choice. These transitions are slow, unpredictable, and often need support to accelerate or shift more rationally.</p>
<p>Another key challenge is the amount of collaboration and coordination necessary to rise to the challenge. Climate mitigation and adaptation touch many sectors, from emergency management to wetlands restoration and public schools. While the new state climate law is a landmark step towards meeting our net zero goals, now comes the hard work of implementation, while we must also move forward on adaptation planning and investments and system modernization across energy, water and land management, telecommunications, commerce, transportation, and much more.   </p>
