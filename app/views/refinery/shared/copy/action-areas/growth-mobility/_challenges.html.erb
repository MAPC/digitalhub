<p>This is a uniquely challenging time to assess the state of our transportation system as we come out of a devasting pandemic that bottomed out ridership (and fares) on public transportation, generated record unemployment, and saw huge numbers of employees and students working from home. Exactly when the transportation system will achieve a “new normal,” and what that will look like, will take some time to ascertain.</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic, emerging innovations in technology, such as hybrid and electric vehicles; transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft; micromobility offerings such as bike and scooter share; and the prospect of automated vehicles were actively reshaping the future of transportation. The pandemic hit pause on some of these trends, but they are showing signs of restarting.</p>
<p>Building back our public transportation system, aligning transportation investments with changing land-use patterns, and planning on how to incorporate new transportation technologies into our region are just some of the major challenges ahead.</p>
<p>Another challenge is overcoming the inequities of our current transportation/housing system. Some people “move until they qualify” – that is, go to live in a community they can afford. Many of these communities, however, are inaccessible to jobs and services, and living in them involves high transportation costs and long commutes. Those who remain in high-cost urban and suburban communities find themselves financially squeezed by high rents and costly transportation.</p>
<p>Environmental hazards, including pollution and noise caused by transportation, unfairly burden BIPOC and low-income communities, with significant health impacts.  And overall, people of color continue to spend more time commuting to and from work than White residents. We have found that Black bus riders spend 64 more hours per year commuting than White riders.  This pattern may only worsen as predominantly White workers in high-paying jobs spend more time working from home, while so-called “essential” workers must still travel to and from a job in a physical location.</p>
<p>Local zoning requirements, such as large minimum lot sizes, off-street parking requirements, and other regulations reinforcing the centrality of the personal auto have spurred an auto-oriented growth pattern over the past half century. Free and convenient parking, public subsidies for road construction and maintenance, and low fuel prices and taxes facilitate the choice to drive. However, we know that this sprawling pattern of growth, even if it is less pronounced than in many other parts of the country, augments inequity and spurs reliance on fossil fuels. Relying on these fuels to power cars, trucks, trains, and buses will not allow us to reduce GHG emissions to state-mandated levels. We also know that relying on personal vehicles cannot be the long-term solution, as there is simply not room on our roadways for everyone to drive.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our public transportation system in Greater Boston has “good bones.” In recent years, the MBTA has focused on improving management practices and the “state of good repair” rates of its fleets. Yet still, the current operations of the MBTA and nearby Regional Transit Authorities are insufficient to meeting the goals of a reliable, affordable, and equitable transportation system. Infrequent service, limited hours of operation, service disruptions, and steady fare hikes are common challenges to creating a more robust and appealing public transportation system. The “hub and spoke” model serves those commuting to and from Boston, but makes for long or impossible journeys to destinations between the “spokes.” Some neighborhoods are underserved by transit options, especially some of those that are home to large BIPOC communities. Good public transit options in lower-density suburbs, and more frequent and affordable service for seniors and those with mobility issues, remain elusive. These shortcomings also contribute to people deciding to drive when that is a viable option.</p>
<p>With limited exceptions, land-use planning and regulation is divorced from transportation planning and investments in Metro Boston. Transit agencies do transit, and municipalities oversee zoning and the other regulations. This disconnect results in new development being located in places that cannot be served by public transportation and, in some cases, new development located next to transit service that is either already at capacity or too infrequent to support ridership.</p>
<p>The type and design of development located close to transit also determines if the new residents or workers will actually use the transit that is available. We have found that residents of higher-price apartments and condos with ample parking are more likely to drive than to take transit, while incorporating less parking into these developments could encourage residents without (or with fewer) cars to move in and use the transit that is provided.</p>
<p>On the positive side, over the past decade, we have seen many more developments built close to transit, a practice known as transit-oriented development (TOD). The new Housing Choice law, which requires multifamily housing districts close to station areas for most of the municipalities in Eastern Massachusetts, should provide an opportunity to integrate land use and transportation more effectively, but all stakeholders need to be part of that conversation in order to deliver on the promise of more integrated and successful development.</p>
<p>How can we raise the funds necessary to invest in the public amenities and goods that our region needs to thrive? Public transportation and art, affordable housing, and open space all have significant funding needs, but exactions on private developments can only be asked up to a certain level before a development proposal no longer makes financial sense. On the public revenue side, tax increases are rarely popular. Each of the identified needs for greater investment has its own constituents and movement behind it. Is it possible to forge a broad-based coalition out of these often-competing interests?</p>
<p>Where and how we grow and travel will, in large part, determine if we can meet our goals for climate, public health, and equity. The challenges we confront are many and include political, financial, legal, and cultural obstacles that have to be overcome, but they are not beyond our grasp to address.</p>
