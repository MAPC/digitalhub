<p>From our earliest cow paths to the streetcar suburbs of the late 19th and early 20th century, Greater Boston’s urbanization radiated out from the core cities in the hub and spoke pattern we see even now on our transit and road maps. With the advent of the automobile and the post-war boom, Metropolitan Boston rapidly suburbanized, continuing the development pattern that defines our region to this day.</p>
<p>Part of that boom was driven by white flight from the central cities, facilitated by the construction of highways and federal policies that opened up access to suburban homeownership to many, but not all. Richard Rothstein and others have demonstrated the racist bias of many of the federal and local housing policies that intentionally excluded Black and other BIPOC communities from benefiting from these programs and from having equal access to all neighborhoods. We live today with the results of this intentional exclusion, demonstrated by ongoing disparities in wealth and homeownership between Black and White households and the highly segregated regional distribution by race.</p>
<p>Our transportation system developed in response to the demands driven by land-use location decisions. Just before the 20th century, Boston launched the nation’s first subway (barely beating New York City). There were subways, trolleys, buses, and regional rail, and many people walked to jobs and elsewhere.</p>
<p>During the suburbanization of the past century, private vehicle ownership skyrocketed to serve the dispersed homes across the region. Taxpayer dollars built highways and often expanded parking lots, while a slow disinvestment from public transportation began. Ring development along Route 128, then 495, and the construction of the Turnpike and I-93 facilitated the movement away from the Inner Core cities. While the personal auto provided convenience and privacy, it also resulted in air pollution, congestion, and the need to convert thousands of acres to roads, parking lots, and other infrastructure needed to support this travel preference. Road and bridge construction and maintenance took precedence over investments in public transportation, walking, and biking.</p>
<p>Our development patterns have also converted thousands of acres of habitat, farm, and wetlands to building sites, roads, and parking. Mass Audubon has documented that 1.1 million acres are now developed, 21% of the state’s land. And we are converting 13.5 acres a day of natural land to new development.  We’ve built some neighborhoods with no publicly accessible open or recreational space. Historic and cultural spaces and buildings have been lost or have been encroached on by new, incompatible development.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, Metro Boston’s downtowns have experienced a resurgence. People returned to cities like Boston, Somerville, and Salem, seeking the benefits of urban living, and in so doing, have reversed decades of population loss. The cities in the Inner Core, particularly, have experienced strong population and employment growth.</p>
<p>Some cities in the Inner Core have tried to get ahead of this growth with an influx of new housing development, while others have resisted growth. Without a balanced effort, it hasn't been possible to add enough housing to meet demand. The urban renaissance has stabilized some cities’ finances and reinvigorated neighborhoods and business districts, but neither the benefits nor the burdens have been evenly shared.</p>
<p>Once-affordable neighborhoods and towns are out of reach even for middle class buyers. As rents and home prices reach historic highs, many long-term residents, immigrants, and artists are priced out. This is hitting low-income and many BIPOC communities especially hard. Seniors on fixed incomes are also increasingly vulnerable to housing instability. For many renters, homeownership in a growing number of communities is simply impossible.  </p>
