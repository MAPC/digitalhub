<p>Our short-term recommendations focus on producing more multifamily, energy-efficient, and affordable homes in downtowns and close to public transportation (also known as smart-growth locations). Deeper subsidies and support for first-generation homebuyers, especially for BIPOC households, are needed. Much stronger interventions to minimize displacement and discrimination in the housing markets, and especially renter protections, must be prioritized. Since the region cannot possibly resolve the housing crisis through supply alone, at least not in the short term, interventions addressing rent regulation is warranted.</p>
