<p>Restrictive and exclusionary zoning is found in many municipalities throughout our region, and local opposition can delay, pare down, and even stop development proposals and rezoning amendments outright. Sentiment in favor of housing and affordable housing is spreading to numerous communities in the region, but opposition remains strong.</p>
<p>The lack of homes affordable to low- and middle-income households force people to pay more and more of their incomes to cover housing costs – or to face displacement to lower-cost places. From 2009 to 2016, home sale prices in Eastern Massachusetts rose 20 percent and wages rose eight percent after adjusting for inflation.  Wage growth in middle- and low-income occupations doesn’t keep up with rising housing costs, creating a further gap between what the market offers and what our residents are able to afford.  Increasing numbers of higher-income owners and lower-income renters compete over limited supply, and current public sector interventions appear insufficient to respond to market trends. Tenant protections, support for low-income homeowners, and efforts to enforce anti-discrimination and Fair Housing laws are lacking or underfunded.</p>
<p>The rapid rise in housing prices and rents over the past decade has placed great pressures on owners and renters, alike. Rent hikes, speculation, condominium conversion, and evictions are forcing people out of their homes and into new communities, sometimes far removed from where they previously lived, and often to municipalities with lower-quality schools and limited opportunities. The pandemic and associated job losses are resulting in even more housing instability for both renters and owners.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively high level of state support for affordable housing programs, there are still not enough resources to meet the demand for permanently affordable units, for subsidies to renters through vouchers, and for supportive housing (i.e., housing that is matched with services). Public housing authorities lack the resources to maintain and modernize their units, which are among the most affordable in the region, and they generally do not have the resources to build new affordable units.</p>
<p>Basing eligibility for subsidized units on 80 percent of the “Areawide Median Income” (AMI) can disadvantage low-income residents who hail from neighborhoods where the median income is much lower than the median income of the entire metropolitan area. However, using AMI based solely on neighborhood or municipality could exacerbate segregation. Creating more units that are eligible for households earning 30 or 50 percent of AMI is critical to making new units truly affordable to those in the most need, even though this requires deeper subsidies. </p>
