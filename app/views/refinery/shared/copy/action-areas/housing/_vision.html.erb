<li>our shared vision imagines a future where all residents have safe and comfortable homes that they can afford in the communities that they prefer. A future where housing is available that meets the needs of the population, regardless of their stage of life, family size, income, or mobility barriers. A future where homelessness no longer exists. Some dream of becoming homeowners and others are happy to rent because their rental prices are stable and predictable. If we succeed in reaching our goals, those that want to buy a home will be able to and no renter or owner will have to pay more than 30% of their income on housing expenses. We also imagine a region that is less segregated, where our communities more closely reflect the demographics of the region as a whole. Homes in the future will be deeply energy efficient, even producing electricity that can feed back into the grid.</li>
