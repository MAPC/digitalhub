<p>Some of our local governments were established over 400 years ago, setting the fundamental organization and governance models that continue to the current day. There is great variability in the size of our localities and their governments, ranging from cities with thousands of employees to small towns – and even a number of large ones – with few professional staff members and a high reliance on volunteers for decision-making, policy-setting, and much more.</p>
<p>As a home rule state, Massachusetts grants to municipalities powers that elsewhere fall to counties or regional authorities. Our 351 cities and towns enjoy wide latitude in governing what happens within their borders, and they provide a host of services and functions. Municipal governments are answerable only to local residents: regional concerns usually take the back seat.</p>
<p>The state does retain jurisdiction over some areas of governance. Among them is the function of raising revenue. The Commonwealth severely constrains municipalities’ ability to raise additional revenues unless approved through state legislative action.</p>
<p>To somewhat address these constraints, the state provides municipalities local aid funding to help fund general operations, schools, and roads. These payments occur on an annual basis and steer greater amounts to fiscally challenged, less wealthy cities. Local aid is entirely dependent on state revenues, however, and it has in the past been cut back during hard economic times, precisely when it is needed most. Many of our revenue-generating mechanisms, like the local property tax and the state sales tax, are regressive in nature, resulting in lower-income residents and workers paying a higher percentage of their income in local and state taxes.</p>
<p>Greater Boston is home to some of the world’s best endowed universities and medical institutions. Although they benefit from their non-profit status, they are governed by boards that have little in the way of public or community representation. One promising model is the increasing use of Community Advisory Boards by hospitals. There is great potential to significantly expand municipal collaboration and partnerships with the non-profit and business sectors to address long-standing challenges. However, municipalities have limited ability to encourage institutions to contribute financially or programmatically to improve their host communities, other than accepting voluntary payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) and community service offerings.</p>
<p>Representation and participation in government has never been equal by race, gender, or economic status. In not-so-distant days, BIPOC and women were intentionally excluded from civic life and voting, denied the rights and privileges enjoyed by White men. While legal barriers to participation have been overthrown, our elected and appointed leadership in state, regional, and local governments still fail to reflect the diversity of our region.  There are signs that diversity amongst elected officials is beginning to increase, yet barriers such as money in politics, the advantages of incumbency, distrust of government, and continuing racism, sexism, and economic insecurity continue to prove high bars to greater diversity in leadership positions. </p>
