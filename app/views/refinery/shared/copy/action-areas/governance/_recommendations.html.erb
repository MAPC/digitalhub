<p>Our recommendations for strengthening our local and regional governments include greater collaboration and representation across governments and with institutional and private sector partners. We would like to see more flexibility and joint decision-making to raise funds from regional sources to address regional challenges. And by making government more accessible and a more rewarding experience, new generations of workers and volunteers of all backgrounds will be more likely to work for and participate in their municipal and regional governments.</p>
