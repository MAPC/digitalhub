<p>The challenges to building a more equitable region are many, as injustices are embedded in the systems that govern society. Undoing the practices and policies that have led to disparities in wealth and health outcomes will require reforms throughout our institutions, both public and private. The primary challenge to creating more equitable wealth and health outcomes is the uneven distribution of political power. This leads to growing income and wealth inequality, which further compounds the differences in power and the ability to participate effectively in government.</p>
<p>Income and wealth inequality have been increasing nationally for decades and the picture in Greater Boson is no different. The fifth of Metro Boston households earning the lowest income are making today only 3% more than they were in 2006, while the fifth of households making the most income are making 15% more. The average income for the highest-earning fifth of households ($280,600) is 18 times higher than the average income for the lowest-income fifth of households ($15,800). That disparity has increased by two points since 2006 (State of Equity, 2018). This is creating two, distinct realities where those that are well off share little in common with the struggles of those trying to survive. For low-income workers, the drive to put food on the table and make ends meet are all-consuming, making it difficult to thrive and lead healthy lives.</p>
<p>This exclusion from opportunities to civically engage also contributes to the uneven distribution of political power. Despite representing all residents in a district, voters, donors, and those who participate in public life have greater access to elected officials. In Massachusetts, the power of incumbency is strong, with many elections uncontested. And money plays an outsized role in politics ever since the Supreme Court in Citizens United found that political contributions are protected as political speech. From 2009 to December 2020, a dozen megadonors contributed $3.4 billion to federal candidates and political group, accounting for 1 out of every 13 dollars raised (Beckel, Michael. Issue One. As reported in the New York Times, April 16, 2021).</p>
<p>Distrust in our political systems stems from a variety of experiences and philosophies. Some have fundamental disagreements over the size and scope of government. For BIPOC communities, distrust stems from centuries of government policies that have marginalized and oppressed them. Personal negative experiences with schools, police and the criminal justice system, or planning processes and development decisions can also contribute to negative views of government. Distrust can also originate through a lack of transparency in decision making and from a lack of information about local processes. The decline of local reporting and rise of social media has only fueled disinformation and views towards government.</p>
<p>As we begin recovery and rebuilding from the COVID-19 pandemic, we face a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in ways that directly undo the history and challenges outlined here. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 is providing hundreds of billions of recovery dollars. Other federal efforts may bring even more resources to support investments in infrastructure and family supports. There will be many competing priorities for these funds, but these federal funds provide a significant opportunity to invest in BIPOC and low-income communities that have faced long-lasting systematic racism and economic exclusion and who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Programs and investments made by state, regional, and municipal governments can also be screened and shifted to center equity. Letâ€™s use this moment to center racial and economic equity as the fundamental focus of recovery and rebuilding.</p>
