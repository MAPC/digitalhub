<p>As we begin recovery and rebuilding from the COVID-19 pandemic, we face a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in ways to directly undo the history and challenges outlined in MetroCommon. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 is providing hundreds of billions of recovery dollars. Other federal efforts may bring even more resources to support investments in infrastructure and family supports. There will be many competing priorities for these funds, but these federal funds provide a significant opportunity to invest in BIPOC and low-income communities that have faced long-lasting systematic racism and economic exclusion and who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. State, regional, and municipal governments should screen prospective investments to center efforts that will create a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. The policy recommendations particularly in Enable Wealth Creation and Intergenerational Wealth Transfer and Reverse the Rising Rate of Chronic Diseases, particularly among Populations Experiencing Health Inequities will help our region, and the Commonwealth as a whole, to center racial and economic equity as the fundamental focus of recovery and rebuilding.</p>
